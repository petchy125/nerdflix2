# NerdFlix 2
-add NX and Cypress to Nerdflix 1 


# NX

- separate each page as micro-frontend
- shared assets, shared components and shared etc should be in shared lib
- could run services individually 
- take advantages of Nx-Cloud to see how fast it is when deploying a micro service app
- have Nx commands for all services : run-build-test-lint and see how they work in local and staging

# Cypress

- add typescript
- Each page should have e2e itself
- E2E testing (Can sample only login flow)
- Component testing (Focus on this)
- Code Coverage 81%
